<h2>Get Started</h2>
<p>Slide-maker has a simple interface and an in browser editor. <strong>Press T to see the tutorial.</strong></p>
<p>Notice that <strong>this app uses the browser local storage</strong> to persist data. If you want, it's possible to download a JSON containing the source code for the slides. Go to the menu and you will see an icon in the top left corner.</p>

<p>You don't need to save each piece of code you write since <strong>the app has autosave built-in</strong>. It automatically save the changes after 0.1s of idling.</p>

<p>Notice that slide-maker can store just one group of slides at a time. If you need to have more than one, just download the current and upload it when needed.</p>
